# Exercise 6

## Goal

  Use the Swagger interactive editor to create API documentation for the API your group designed previously.

## Getting Started

  + Run `npm start` in the repository directory
  + Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or one of the other URLs displayed
  + Use `File` > `Open Example` to load an example file
  + Look at example.yaml for a basic template to start with, or guide.yaml for more verbose comments 
  + Create documentation for the API your group defined
 
### Alternative instructions if you were unable to download the repository or install Node
  + Navigate to http://editor.swagger.io/
  + Look at echo.yaml for examples and start with minimal.yaml to make your own.
